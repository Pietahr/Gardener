# Final Project

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


## Assignment

This course will be evaluated through a programming project. The requirements for this project are as follows:
Work is done individually. You are allowed to discuss your project or problems you encounter with others but you are not allowed to share code with others. If you use code found online, you are required to mention this using a "// Source:" comment. Code you did not write yourself does not add to your grade. This includes code that was written by following a tutorial. Failure to mention sources will count as cheating.

The project should demonstrate that you understand and can apply the following:
- The Swift programming language.
- Basic architecture of iOS applications using common design patterns like Model-View-Controller and Delegation.
- Auto Layout, Size Classes and UIStackView.
- Storyboards, segues and common viewcontrollers like UINavigationController, UITabBarController and UISplitViewController.
- UITableView and/or UICollectionView.
- The project should also demonstrate that you can learn new things on your own. This means your project must include either material not covered in class but related to topics covered in class (like custom layouts for UICollectionView) or completely new material (Core Location, Maps, Core Graphics, Core Animation, Core Data, CloudKit, WatchKit, SpriteKit, SceneKit, …).

You are free to choose the subject of your project. Pick something you like so you’ll enjoy working on it. Games are allowed only if they satisfy the requirements specified above. Remember that your goal is not to build a sellable app, only to show your skills.

The intent of this programming project is also to prove to future employers that you’ve acquired basic iOS development skills. For this reason, you will be required to publish your project, along with a page introducing and describing it, on your personal website, blog, portfolio or GitHub page. Your complete source code should be made available unless you have a good reason not to publish it.
Your final project must be submitted no later than Sunday January 7, 2018. You will need to submit a link to where you’ve published your project to a Chamilo assignment. Make sure it’s easy for me to download and run your project without any further configuration or modification. Happy teachers give better grades!
